# Zero to Mastery Complete React JS E-Commerce Project

## Description:
This e-commerce site was built as a capstone project for Zero to Mastery's Complete React Developer in 2023 (w/Redux, Hooks, GraphQL) Course.<br />

As this course progressed from a simple create-react-app with basic React JS skills, the course took me through Hooks, Context API, Redux, Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga, and much much more.  This project, which I named Nash-Clothing (due to my location of Nashville, TN) is a complete e-commerce site from start to finish.  There are a few 'real-world' features not yet implemented, but the user can sign up, sign in, navigate through categories, add items to cart, checkout, and (ultimately) pay with a credit card via Stripe.  Stripe is integrated with Netlify where the site is hosted.<br />

Please feel free to browse the code within this repository.  It is neat, clean, and well-organized. Thanks for stopping by!
